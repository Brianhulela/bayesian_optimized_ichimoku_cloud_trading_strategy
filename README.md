# Bayesian Optimized Ichimoku Cloud Trading Strategy

This repository contains a Python implementation of an Ichimoku Cloud trading strategy optimized using **Bayesian Optimization**. The project is a continuation of a previous study where the strategy was backtested with hand-picked parameters. By applying Bayesian Optimization, the strategy's returns were improved significantly, while risk (measured by maximum drawdown) was reduced.  

I go into the details of this implementation on my [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@brianhulela/i-optimized-the-ichimoku-cloud-trading-strategy-with-bayesian-optimization-from-32-to-168-returns-5a81c46ec143).

You can check out the [previous implementation](https://github.com/Brianhulela/ichimoku_cloud_trading_strategy) of this strategy with hand-picked parameters.

Key highlights:
- Uses historical stock data to backtest the strategy.
- Optimizes Ichimoku Cloud parameters to maximize returns.
- Includes visualization of the Ichimoku Cloud, trade signals, and equity curve.
- Demonstrates the impact of systematic parameter optimization on strategy performance.
