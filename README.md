# Bayesian Optimized Ichimoku Cloud Trading Strategy

This repository contains a Python implementation of an Ichimoku Cloud trading strategy optimized using **Bayesian Optimization**. The project is a continuation of a previous study where the strategy was backtested with hand-picked parameters. By applying Bayesian Optimization, the strategy's returns were improved significantly, while risk (measured by maximum drawdown) was reduced.  

Key highlights:
- Uses historical stock data to backtest the strategy.
- Optimizes Ichimoku Cloud parameters to maximize returns.
- Includes visualization of the Ichimoku Cloud, trade signals, and equity curve.
- Demonstrates the impact of systematic parameter optimization on strategy performance.
